        <strong>Cocktail</strong>
        <br />A cocktail is an alcoholic mixed drink. Most commonly, cocktails
        are either a combination of spirits, or one or more spirits mixed with
        other ingredients such as tonic water, fruit juice, flavored syrup, or
        cream. Cocktails vary widely across regions of the world, and many
        websites publish both original recipes and their own interpretations of
        older and more famous cocktails.

        <strong>History</strong>
        <br />
        The origins of the word cocktail have been debated. The first written
        mention of cocktail as a beverage appeared in The Farmers Cabinet, 1803
        in the United States. The first definition of a cocktail as an alcoholic
        beverage appeared three years later in The Balance and Columbian
        Repository (Hudson, New York) May 13, 1806. Traditionally, cocktail
        ingredients included spirits, sugar, water and bitters, however, this
        definition evolved throughout the 1800s, to include the addition of a
        liqueur. <br />
        In 1862 Jerry Thomas published a bartenders’ guide called How to Mix
        Drinks; or, The Bon Vivant's Companion which included 10 cocktail
        recipes using bitters to differentiate from other drinks such as punches
        and cobblers. Cocktails continued to evolve and gain popularity
        throughout the 1900s, and in 1917 the term "cocktail party" was coined
        by Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri. With wine and beer
        being less available during the Prohibition in the United States
        (1920–1933), liquor-based cocktails became more popular due to
        accessibility, followed by a decline in popularity during the late
        1960s. The early to mid-2000s saw the rise of cocktail culture through
        the style of mixology which mixes traditional cocktails and other novel
        ingredients. <br />
        In the modern world and the Information Age, cocktail recipes are widely
        shared online on websites. Cocktails and restaurants that serve them are
        frequently covered and reviewed in tourism magazines and guides. 
        Some cocktails, such as the Mojito, Manhattan, and Martini have become
        both staples in most restaurants and pop culture phenomena, martinis
        specifically being associated with James Bond and his phrase "shaken,
        not stirred".

        <strong>Usage and related terms</strong>
        <br />
        The Oxford Dictionaries define cocktail as "An alcoholic drink
        consisting of a spirit or spirits mixed with other ingredients, such as
        fruit juice or cream". A cocktail can contain alcohol, a sugar, and
        a bitter/citrus. When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and
        a mixer, such as soda or fruit juice, it is a highball. Many of the
        International Bartenders Association Official Cocktails are highballs.
        When a mixed drink contains only a distilled spirit and a liqueur, it is
        a duo, and when it adds a mixer, it is a trio. Additional ingredients
        may be sugar, honey, milk, cream, and various herbs.
        <br />
        Mixed drinks without alcohol that resemble cocktails are known as
        "mocktails" or "virgin cocktails".
